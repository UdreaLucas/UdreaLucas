🙋‍♂️ Hi there! I'm Lucas Udrea, a passionate and dedicated Computer Science student at UTN FRM, currently pursuing a Technicatura degree. I am on my journey to becoming a FullStack Developer, driven by the excitement of constant challenges and the joy of solving intriguing problems.

📚 My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in algorithms, logic, and other essential aspects of computer science. Through my coursework and personal projects, I have developed a solid understanding of both backend and frontend technologies.

💻 On the backend, I have experience working with Java and Spring Boot, and I am proficient in managing SQL and NoSQL databases. For the frontend, I am skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and React. Additionally, I am well-versed in using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

🌐 My proficiency in English, both as a reader and speaker, is demonstrated by my C2 level EFSET certificate, a testament to my dedication to learning the language since childhood. My passion for languages extends beyond English, as I enjoy exploring new languages and cultures.
